Implement strStr() 
https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/


Implement strStr().

Returns the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if 
needle is not part of haystack.

Update (2014-11-02):
The signature of the function had been updated to return the index instead of 
the pointer. If you still see your function signature returns a char * or 
String, please click the reload button  to reset your code definition.


(EASY) Two Pointers, String

/*
It's easy to implement a brute-force algorithm, with a pitfall to exceed the 
time for special cases.
(Also, the special case when needle == '' needs to be considered.)

class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(char *haystack, char *needle) {
        int i = 0;
        int len_needle = strlen(needle);
        if (len_needle == 0) return 0;
        while (*haystack != 0) {
            char *p1 = haystack;
            char *p2 = needle;
            int j=0;
            for (; *p1 == *p2 && *p1 != 0 && *p2 != 0; p1++, p2++) {}
            if (*p2 == 0) return i;
            haystack++;
            i++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};

When the 'needle' is very very long, and only mismatch at the end, it may still
running after the leftovers of haystack is shorter than needle, which is 
unnecessary.
To fix this, get the length of needle and if the leftover is shorter than this, 
terminate. 
Also note the boundary condition, to avoid failing in special cases such as 
"baa" vs. "aa", use (haystack+len_needle-1), not (haystack+len_needle), as the 
loop condition.

class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(char *haystack, char *needle) {
        int i = 0;
        int len_needle = strlen(needle);
        if (len_needle == 0) return 0;
        while (*(haystack + len_needle - 1) != 0) {
            char *p1 = haystack;
            char *p2 = needle;
            int j=0;
            for (; *p1 == *p2 && *p1 != 0 && *p2 != 0; p1++, p2++) {}
            if (*p2 == 0) return i;
            haystack++;
            i++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};

Also note that there is a chance in the loop where we meet the end of the 
haystack first, when it is time to terminate the loop. In this case we don't 
need to modify the loop condition.
See solution below for this method. (Also note that the original loop condition 
is useless, where I put 'true' instead.)
